In this activity, I created an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL. The app takes in orders from customers and provides the total cost of the purchase if the item is in stock. If there is not enough of a particular product available, the client will be told that the quantity is insufficient and how much is actually in stock. Click on the link below to see it in action.
